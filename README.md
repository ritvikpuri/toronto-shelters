# Home Sweet Home

## Overview of Paper

The repository contains the paper and other files exploring the current situation of the Shelter Program System of the City of Toronto provided by the Shelter, Support & Housing Administration (SSHA) and monitored by the SMIS database. The data can be found [here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-overnight-service-occupancy-capacity/)
After analyzing the data it is clear to see that the shelters are functioning at near maximum of their capacity, especially after the pandemic, and the City Council should come up with more ways to help the homeless. The final paper can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ritvikpuri/toronto-shelters/blob/main/outputs/paper/paper.pdf)
